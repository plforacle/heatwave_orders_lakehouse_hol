# Introduction

## About this Workshop

MySQL HeatWave is a fully managed database service powered by the HeatWave in-memory query accelerator. It’s the only cloud service that combines transactions, real-time analytics across data warehouses and data lakes, machine learning, and lakehouse in one MySQL Database—without the complexity, latency, risks, and cost of ETL duplication. It’s available on OCI, AWS, and Azure.

In this workshop, you will learn how to create a MySQL HeatWave Cluster, connect to the cluster using MySQL Shell, run queries on HeatWave, and create LAMP applications.

Overall this workshop will show you how easy it is to create and manage MySQL HeatWave and how MySQL HeatWave enables you to make informed business-critical decisions with real-time insights.

_Estimated Time:_ 1 hours

### About Product/Technology

MySQL HeatWave is a massively parallel, high performance, in-memory query accelerator for Oracle MySQL Database Service that accelerates MySQL performance by orders of magnitude for analytics and mixed workloads. It is the only service that enables customers to run OLTP and OLAP workloads directly from their MySQL database without the need of ETL process. MySQL Autopilot uses advanced machine-learning techniques to automates the database lifecycle operations including provisioning, data loading, query processing, and error handling. This minimizes manual administrative work and further improves HeatWave’s usability, performance, and scalability. MySQL HeatWave is also integrated with other Oracle Cloud services such as Data Integration Service and Oracle Analytics Cloud to provide a seamless end-to-end integration.
